# deep4j
A deep learning library written in java

This is still a work in progress, The main intention of this library is for
pedagogical purposes only.

The idea is that someone interested in knowing how neural networks are implemented
can checkout the code and read/modify the code. Therefore it is written in a very
simple style.

For production please use other well mainted projects liked deeplearning4j.

Future plans are to add:
- CNN
- RNN
- GAN
